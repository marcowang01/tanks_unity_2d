- the white dots will predict the path of travel of bombs you throw
- the prediction will move dynamically according to the power and angle
- There is a cool down timer for shooting, player can fire twice every second
- Enemies (tumbling gears) will start spawning at the right end of the map as soon as the game begins
- They will damage the player if they collide with the player (sound will play here)
- The bombs will blow the enemies away
- As you score points, the enemies will roll faster and spawn more frequently
- After a certain number of points, the game will enter the final turbo mode
- During the final stage, enemies will pile up and spawn extremely quickly (you will likely lose here)
